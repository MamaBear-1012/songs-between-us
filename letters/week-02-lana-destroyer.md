# Destroyer — Kiss

*(Week 2 – picked by Lana)*

This week:  KISS Destroyer. This came out when I was 10. The band was already legendary at this time but well outside mainstream music. I can’t remember if I already had their other albums. But I remember listening over and over to this record. I loved the songwriting and the cleverness of non musical sounds - I hadn’t heard anything quite like it before. I remember wanting it in the beginning because of the song Beth which is so beautiful…. My puppy love boyfriend Gary Coker and his friends played a KISS song for the talent show and he dressed up like Peter Cris. Silly…KISS is most likely where I began finding music that was outside of mainstream music that was played on the radio and I thought I was pretty cool for that. Anyways I hope you like it.
