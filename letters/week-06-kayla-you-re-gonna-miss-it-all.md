# You're Gonna Miss It All — Modern Baseball

*(Week 6 – picked by Kayla)*

Here’s your pick for the week! Modern Baseball. Another great Midwest emo band. They were pretty big with the front bottoms in the 2010’s. I’ve seen them 8 times or more. It’s two different guys that sing. They all met college and made a band. They went on indefinite hiatus in 2017 😭 I love this album I think they really capture what it’s like to be a young adult in 2000’s with cell phones and social media. Some of my favorite songs on this album are broken cash machine, the old gospel choir, your graduation (!!!!) and two good things. I think you will really like them 🤔
