# Upstairs at Eric's — Yaz

*(Week 7 – picked by Lana)*

I hope you really love this one. It was a pivotal album in my little life. It was a really awkward time for me. I was no longer a competitive gymnast. I tried out for Pom and made it. Twice we did Pom Follies (get together of the 4 high schools in Tempe did dances to two songs from this album - because our captain was really cool and new wave) funny that we used this album cause it was only the outcasts that were into this kind of music. Most popular songs were Don’t Go & Situation my friend Sivi used to sing the verse as Goob Out - Goob Out (you’ll figure out where 🤣🤣) This album - helped me to appreciate my “differentness” as something that did make me less but made me feel like it was something to celebrate and be proud of.  And most importantly to find my people. The only song that is not amazing is I before E but i try hard to appreciate it - because it is really artistic and cool in its own way. Monumental album!  You will be dancing to this one for sure!!
