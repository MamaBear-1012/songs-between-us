# Fevers and Mirrors — Bright Eyes

*(Week 8 – picked by Kayla)*

My pick for you this week is Fevers and Mirrors by Bright Eyes. This album saved me like 100 million times. I love the calendar hung itself, I used to want to get the last verse tattooed on my ribs lol. The song Something vague - there’s a verse about being on a bridge with his mom and brothers and I always think of that small little bridge in the townhome complex dad lived in in mount kisco I think. And there was like a creek or something it went over. Haligh haligh - this song really could go line by line and tell you how i relate to it. One of my fave memories was being in the car with Tamar Renato and some of their friends and everyone was singing this song at the top of their lungs. The center of the world - so good!!!!!! Sunrise, sunset - so good and the first time I remember listening to it I was folding shirts at bolt printing in like 2012 anytime this song comes on i go back to that exact moment in the warehouse of being like wow I love this song. An attempt to tip the scales - such a great song and then it goes into the weirdest fake interview of him. I quote it all the time. A song to pass the time - Tamar and Keira love this song. I’ve never liked it. But now when it comes on I’ll listen for Keira.
