# Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair — La Dispute

*(Week 5 – picked by Kayla)*

Get ready. This is La Dispute. They are pioneers in this genre bending style of music. It’s post hardcore mixed with spoken word and elements of jazz and blues. I remember the first time I heard them I was like wtf is this. I was delivering pizza at Joe’s. I went to play them for someone else to be like isn’t this weird and when I put them on for them. I was like huh maybe I like this? And now they are one of my favorites. I’ve got their band logo tattooed on my shoulder. They are from Grand Rapids, Michigan. A lot of their music focuses on how bad their community has been hit by poverty, drug addiction, and crime on black people. The lead singer is the most plain looking guy like he looks like he works in an office and I love the way he dances all over the stage when they perform. He jumps in the crowd and lets fans scream into the mic. They do a lot of community work. This album in particular is a lot about loving people with drug addiction and how painful it is to watch people you love struggle. It’s hard to even pick a stand out because I think this is an unskippable album. The song fall down never get back up again, always makes me think of how painful it was watching kayla hay just drown in her addiction. The last lost continent is 12 min song but it’s probably one of my favorites from the album. That one is also about having loved ones with drug addiction.
