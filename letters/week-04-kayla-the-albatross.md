# The Albatross — Foxing

*(Week 4 – picked by Kayla)*

My pick for you this week is The Albatross by Foxing. This was their first album and it stands in my top 10 albums of all time. Ive seen these guys 7 or 8 times. The first time I saw them, I had no idea who they were. they opened for Brand New and they played my heart will go on by Celine Dion over the speakers before they came out. They were touring with this album and I just loved them right away. I remember going back to my apartment and listening to the album on bandcamp for free. I think some of their later albums you will like a lot more. The first song Bloodhound, I wanted to be my wedding entrance song for the longest time lol The lead singer also plays the trumpet and they use the trumpet so well. They’ve got unbelievable stage presence, I’ll send you a video or pictures of when I have seen them. Some of my favorites from this album are bloodhound, Inuit, the medic, Rory and bit by a dead bee pt 2, and quietus.
