# Gold — Neil Diamond

*(Week 3 – picked by Lana)*

This is a step back. I actually debated if this should have been my first pick.  Neil Diamond live. The album I wanted to select is Hot August Night it is two hours long. But this one will do the trick. This is the only music that my mom played on Sundays that I loved. She would clean our apartment and play records.  I remember his songs making me feeling happy almost joyful and others that made me feel a little sad. The orchestra like music is beautiful and combined with his genuineness they made me feel safe, happy and got me to think deeply. I secretly wished Neil Diamond could be my father. He is exactly the kind of father I imagined Rob was, or what I wished Chuck could have been. A man who was caring, kind, and wholesome. I was very very young - but his songs and music is what formed and ultimately shaped the music I would later be drawn to…The Cure. When I listen to Neil Diamond today - I feel like I am sitting with my little self - I always call her Lanie.❤️
