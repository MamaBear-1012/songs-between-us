# The Head On the Door — The Cure

*(Week 8 – picked by Lana)*

This is where it all began for me and my absolute adoration of The Cure and Robert Smith. I went on a weekend trip with a few people (I don’t remember who exactly) to San Diego. Someone had this on cassette - it was so good. I remember listening to this non stop on the trip sitting on the beach with a boom box and then back at the motel sitting outside smoking cigarettes. I think the people I was with might have wanted to listen to something else but every time I could I put this in and played it over and over. When I got home I went to the record store and bought the cassette. And played it in my room the same way over and over. When I went to the car I brought it with me. Every song is perfect and beautiful. I think my original favorites were Six Different Ways and Sinking. In Between Days and Close To Me were popular on college radio and they had cool videos to go with. Lisa and I used to do the cutest thing to Close To Me tapping our fingers to the ding ding ding on each other. I still tap my fingers when I hear this song and I am filled with happiness at my friendship with Lisa. The Blood opening line “Who doesn’t love what can never come back” is about Jesus - but now it makes me think of Chloe, Granny and Laura. In concert they play several songs from this album. A super fan favorite is Push. People go wild snd it just makes me feel joy! The Baby Screams is so Robert Smith I love his voice and I love singing this one. Welcome to your Cure Journey❤️
