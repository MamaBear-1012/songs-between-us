# Talon of the Hawk — The Front Bottoms

*(Week 1 – picked by Kayla)*

Here you go. I give you Talon of the Hawk by the front bottoms. They are from New Jersey. I’ve seen these guys idk 10 times or more in concert. They are so much fun to see , everyone in the crowd sings at top of their lungs and jumps and down the whole time.  Track 4, Twin Size Mattress always makes me think of Keira back when she started going to all these different treatment places all over the country. I really like the story-telling style of songwriting and drums throughout the album they are just top tier.
