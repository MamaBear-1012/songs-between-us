1,Kayla,Talon of the Hawk,The Front Bottoms,2013,https://music.apple.com/us/album/talon-of-the-hawk/1518089263,"Here you go. I give you Talon of the Hawk by the front bottoms. They are from New Jersey. I’ve seen these guys idk 10 times or more in concert. They are so much fun to see , everyone in the crowd sings at top of their lungs and jumps and down the whole time.  Track 4, Twin Size Mattress always makes me think of Keira back when she started going to all these different treatment places all over the country. I really like the story-telling style of songwriting and drums throughout the album they are just top tier.",2025-10-07,talon-of-the-hawk,2025-10-07
2,Kayla,A Black Mile To The Surface,Manchester Orchestra,2017,https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-black-mile-to-the-surface/1440945297,"This is my pick for you this week. This album came out the summer after Chloe died so I always feel think of her when I listen to it. I listened to it over and over on my two hour drive to UConn Waterbury for my Spanish summer class and I would take route 8 through all these gorgeous valleys in CT. I love so much about this album. My favorite thing is every song leads to the next one. I get tears in my eyes at the first song. The Alien makes me think of Chloe the most. And there’s a line he sings the whole time that repeats it something like “didn’t mean to” and I always think it was her message to me like she really didn’t mean to die. And that song the alien goes right into the sunshine which is his song to his daughter and i love that song so much too. The final song the silence is my favorite, the last verse is to his daughter and it just gets me every time. Lead singer is Andy hull and his dad  was a pastor so there’s a lot of struggle with god and trying to find yourself which I love and he’s got very hymn like vibe it’s hard to put in words.",2025-10-13,a-black-mile-to-the-surface,2025-10-13
3,Kayla,"LIFTED or the Story is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground",Bright Eyes,2002,https://music.apple.com/us/album/lifted-or-the-story-is-in-the-soil-keep-your-ear-to-the-ground/1565218167,"Here’s my album for this week. Lifted or the story is in the soil keep your ear to the ground by Bright Eyes. Conor Oberst is my favorite songwriter. This album has some of my absolute favorites of his songwriting. There are several songs on here that I would say are in my top 10. Idk why but his voice reminds of Robert smith sometimes. And i believe he was heavily influenced by the cure so I’ve always thought of you when I listen to him and think like how cool her band made my favorite songwriter. I’ve been listening to this album since I was 21 so it’s been through everything with me. The song you will. You? Will. You? Will. Me and Tamar always used to do a funny bit where we would go you will? Will you? You will? So I always laugh to myself when i see this song come on. Make War i listened to when I was taking a shuttle back from kayla Wray’s to airport after we broke up and it was like 6 am and the sun was coming up over the desert. A day is gonna come, waste of paint and let’s not shit ourselves are some of my favorite songs ever in the entire world. Bowls of oranges is a such a great song too. I think he has a very beautiful view on life and being a human between all the sadness.",2025-10-21,lifted-or-the-story-is-in-the-soil-keep-your-ear-to-the-ground,2025-10-21
4,Kayla,The Albatross,Foxing,2023,https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-albatross-ten-years/1703619008,"My pick for you this week is The Albatross by Foxing. This was their first album and it stands in my top 10 albums of all time. Ive seen these guys 7 or 8 times. The first time I saw them, I had no idea who they were. they opened for Brand New and they played my heart will go on by Celine Dion over the speakers before they came out. They were touring with this album and I just loved them right away. I remember going back to my apartment and listening to the album on bandcamp for free. I think some of their later albums you will like a lot more. The first song Bloodhound, I wanted to be my wedding entrance song for the longest time lol The lead singer also plays the trumpet and they use the trumpet so well. They’ve got unbelievable stage presence, I’ll send you a video or pictures of when I have seen them. Some of my favorites from this album are bloodhound, Inuit, the medic, Rory and bit by a dead bee pt 2, and quietus.",2025-10-27,the-albatross,2025-10-27
5,Kayla,Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair,La Dispute,2018,https://music.apple.com/us/album/somewhere-at-the-bottom-of-the-river-between/1676942123,"Get ready. This is La Dispute. They are pioneers in this genre bending style of music. It’s post hardcore mixed with spoken word and elements of jazz and blues. I remember the first time I heard them I was like wtf is this. I was delivering pizza at Joe’s. I went to play them for someone else to be like isn’t this weird and when I put them on for them. I was like huh maybe I like this? And now they are one of my favorites. I’ve got their band logo tattooed on my shoulder. They are from Grand Rapids, Michigan. A lot of their music focuses on how bad their community has been hit by poverty, drug addiction, and crime on black people. The lead singer is the most plain looking guy like he looks like he works in an office and I love the way he dances all over the stage when they perform. He jumps in the crowd and lets fans scream into the mic. They do a lot of community work. This album in particular is a lot about loving people with drug addiction and how painful it is to watch people you love struggle. It’s hard to even pick a stand out because I think this is an unskippable album. The song fall down never get back up again, always makes me think of how painful it was watching kayla hay just drown in her addiction. The last lost continent is 12 min song but it’s probably one of my favorites from the album. That one is also about having loved ones with drug addiction.",2025-11-03,somewhere-at-the-bottom-of-the-river-between-vega-and-altair,2025-11-03
6,Kayla,You're Gonna Miss It All,Modern Baseball,2014,https://music.apple.com/us/album/youre-gonna-miss-it-all/1496548525,"Here’s your pick for the week! Modern Baseball. Another great Midwest emo band. They were pretty big with the front bottoms in the 2010’s. I’ve seen them 8 times or more. It’s two different guys that sing. They all met college and made a band. They went on indefinite hiatus in 2017 😭 I love this album I think they really capture what it’s like to be a young adult in 2000’s with cell phones and social media. Some of my favorite songs on this album are broken cash machine, the old gospel choir, your graduation (!!!!) and two good things. I think you will really like them 🤔",2025-11-11,you-re-gonna-miss-it-all,2025-11-11
7,Kayla,Hit Me Hard and Soft,Billie Eilish,2024,https://music.apple.com/us/album/hit-me-hard-and-soft/1739659134,"My pick for you this week is Billie! This album came out two summers ago and I still listen to it all the time. In fact, Spotify sends you your listening statistics for the year and in 2023, I was in top .5% of listeners for this album 🤣 It’s a great album to run too. When I first listened to this, I was not a Billie fan. I liked a few of her songs but that was it. And the first two times I listened through this album I was like well that was pretty mediocre and basic but somewhere between 3rd and 4th listen, the album transformed into one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard. Billie has something called synesthesia which means she sees color when she hears music. What colors does this album make you think of? Idk how much you know about Billie. But her brother and her write and record all the music together. And they have pioneered a new way of edit and layering vocal tracks. Sometimes they’ll have 50 different vocal tracks of her in one song. It’s actually pretty incredible and I say this as someone who was little snobby about pop music before I love every song on this album except lunch which is the single. I wish they would take the last 3 songs and make a long music video to it. Chihiro is probably my favorite song of the album I could listen to it on a loop. Blue is not far behind. I wonder what you will think 🤔",2025-11-17,hit-me-hard-and-soft,2025-11-17
8,Kayla,Fevers and Mirrors,Bright Eyes,2000,https://music.apple.com/us/album/fevers-and-mirrors/1565228579,"My pick for you this week is Fevers and Mirrors by Bright Eyes. This album saved me like 100 million times. I love the calendar hung itself, I used to want to get the last verse tattooed on my ribs lol. The song Something vague - there’s a verse about being on a bridge with his mom and brothers and I always think of that small little bridge in the townhome complex dad lived in in mount kisco I think. And there was like a creek or something it went over. Haligh haligh - this song really could go line by line and tell you how i relate to it. One of my fave memories was being in the car with Tamar Renato and some of their friends and everyone was singing this song at the top of their lungs. The center of the world - so good!!!!!! Sunrise, sunset - so good and the first time I remember listening to it I was folding shirts at bolt printing in like 2012 anytime this song comes on i go back to that exact moment in the warehouse of being like wow I love this song. An attempt to tip the scales - such a great song and then it goes into the weirdest fake interview of him. I quote it all the time. A song to pass the time - Tamar and Keira love this song. I’ve never liked it. But now when it comes on I’ll listen for Keira.",2025-11-25,fevers-and-mirrors,2025-11-25
1,Lana,A Night at the Opera,Queen,1975,https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-night-at-the-opera/1440806041,This is one of the first records I owned. I played it over and over and over when I was in junior high. It is really fun to sing too and has very different musical styles. And lastly bohemian rhapsodie. I remember the first time hearing that song on the radio. Late at night with Laura in our trundle beds. And the trending debate about how long the song was over 6min.,2025-10-05,a-night-at-the-opera,2025-10-05
2,Lana,Destroyer,Kiss,1976,https://music.apple.com/us/album/destroyer-45th-anniversary-remastered/1596798921,This week:  KISS Destroyer. This came out when I was 10. The band was already legendary at this time but well outside mainstream music. I can’t remember if I already had their other albums. But I remember listening over and over to this record. I loved the songwriting and the cleverness of non musical sounds - I hadn’t heard anything quite like it before. I remember wanting it in the beginning because of the song Beth which is so beautiful…. My puppy love boyfriend Gary Coker and his friends played a KISS song for the talent show and he dressed up like Peter Cris. Silly…KISS is most likely where I began finding music that was outside of mainstream music that was played on the radio and I thought I was pretty cool for that. Anyways I hope you like it.,2025-10-12,destroyer,2025-10-12
3,Lana,Gold,Neil Diamond,1970,https://music.apple.com/us/album/gold-live-at-the-troubadour-1970/1423334276,"This is a step back. I actually debated if this should have been my first pick.  Neil Diamond live. The album I wanted to select is Hot August Night it is two hours long. But this one will do the trick. This is the only music that my mom played on Sundays that I loved. She would clean our apartment and play records.  I remember his songs making me feeling happy almost joyful and others that made me feel a little sad. The orchestra like music is beautiful and combined with his genuineness they made me feel safe, happy and got me to think deeply. I secretly wished Neil Diamond could be my father. He is exactly the kind of father I imagined Rob was, or what I wished Chuck could have been. A man who was caring, kind, and wholesome. I was very very young - but his songs and music is what formed and ultimately shaped the music I would later be drawn to…The Cure. When I listen to Neil Diamond today - I feel like I am sitting with my little self - I always call her Lanie.❤️",2025-10-19,gold,2025-10-19
4,Lana,Van Halen,Van Halen,1978,https://music.apple.com/us/album/van-halen/976820530,"Are you ready for Week 4? I almost forgot about this one. I didn’t own it, Laura did. And I would secretly borrow and listen to this album. It was a game changer in hard rock it came out when I was 12 in Junior High. This is when I was really heavy into gymnastics and when Laura started partying really hard. This is VanHalen’s 1st album and was remarkable at the time because David Lee Roth the lead singer had an interesting voice, with cool screams, he was drop dead gorgeous, had the most beautiful smile, was an incredible showman. Then Eddie VanHalen the lead guitarist played like no one else on the planet. I am sure he is still known as one of the greatest guitar players of all time.  And Michael Anthony he is what gives VanHalen the harmony. I would have probably liked them much more later on but when they fired David Lee Roth it made me mad. All the songs on this album are great. But the standouts: Running with the Devil, Eruption (mind blowing), You Really Got Me, Jamie’s Cryin’, Feel Your Lovin Tonight, Ice Cream Man - didn’t realize until now that the sexual overtones in that one - oh oh. Anyways it is a lot of fun and play it loud! I hope you like it.",2025-10-26,van-halen,2025-10-26
5,Lana,Moving Pictures,Rush,1981,https://music.apple.com/us/album/moving-pictures-remastered/1440798539,"My 1st high school boyfriend Jason Monkelien introduced me to this album. I remember hearing the song Red Barchetta and just feeling that it was a musical story that i could actually visualize. It was like reading a book where I envisioned the scenery, characters and the story in my mind.  The most popular songs: Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Vital Signs, are great - but Red Barchetta is on my list of my favorite songs There are just three members in the band and the music that these three people can make is just ridiculously brilliant. When they were accepted into the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame - Alex Lifeson’s Blah Blah speech remains as the best speech I have ever seen by anyone. I hope you love this one. 🥰",2025-11-02,moving-pictures,2025-11-02
6,Lana,Beauty and the Beat,The Go-Go's,1981,https://music.apple.com/us/album/beauty-and-the-beat/1440843867,"This came out when I was a sophmore in high school. I loved them and I loved this record. I still know all the songs. It is #400 on top 500. The first single our lips are sealed was so good. There were no real girl bands at the time so this was really unheard of - well in my world at the time. They didn’t look hardened and mean like a lot of women in rock. It is just fun to listen to it would be hard to pick a favorite more like less favorites (we got the beat, can’t stop the world, skidmarks on my heart, you can’t walk in your sleep) the rest are so good I couldn’t even rank them. This was my first concert. They opened for the Police (never been a fan of them).  I think they lip synched but it was a fun concert. I hope you dance around to this one. 👯‍♀️",2025-11-09,beauty-and-the-beat,2025-11-09
7,Lana,Upstairs at Eric's,Yaz,1982,https://music.apple.com/us/album/upstairs-at-erics/62442885,I hope you really love this one. It was a pivotal album in my little life. It was a really awkward time for me. I was no longer a competitive gymnast. I tried out for Pom and made it. Twice we did Pom Follies (get together of the 4 high schools in Tempe did dances to two songs from this album - because our captain was really cool and new wave) funny that we used this album cause it was only the outcasts that were into this kind of music. Most popular songs were Don’t Go & Situation my friend Sivi used to sing the verse as Goob Out - Goob Out (you’ll figure out where 🤣🤣) This album - helped me to appreciate my “differentness” as something that did make me less but made me feel like it was something to celebrate and be proud of.  And most importantly to find my people. The only song that is not amazing is I before E but i try hard to appreciate it - because it is really artistic and cool in its own way. Monumental album!  You will be dancing to this one for sure!!,2025-11-16,upstairs-at-eric-s,2025-11-16
8,Lana,The Head On the Door,The Cure,1985,https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-head-on-the-door/282971465,"This is where it all began for me and my absolute adoration of The Cure and Robert Smith. I went on a weekend trip with a few people (I don’t remember who exactly) to San Diego. Someone had this on cassette - it was so good. I remember listening to this non stop on the trip sitting on the beach with a boom box and then back at the motel sitting outside smoking cigarettes. I think the people I was with might have wanted to listen to something else but every time I could I put this in and played it over and over. When I got home I went to the record store and bought the cassette. And played it in my room the same way over and over. When I went to the car I brought it with me. Every song is perfect and beautiful. I think my original favorites were Six Different Ways and Sinking. In Between Days and Close To Me were popular on college radio and they had cool videos to go with. Lisa and I used to do the cutest thing to Close To Me tapping our fingers to the ding ding ding on each other. I still tap my fingers when I hear this song and I am filled with happiness at my friendship with Lisa. The Blood opening line “Who doesn’t love what can never come back” is about Jesus - but now it makes me think of Chloe, Granny and Laura. In concert they play several songs from this album. A super fan favorite is Push. People go wild snd it just makes me feel joy! The Baby Screams is so Robert Smith I love his voice and I love singing this one. Welcome to your Cure Journey❤️",2025-11-24,the-head-on-the-door,2025-11-24
