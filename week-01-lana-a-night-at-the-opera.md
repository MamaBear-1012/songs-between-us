# A Night at the Opera — Queen

*(Week 1 – picked by Lana)*

This is one of the first records I owned. I played it over and over and over when I was in junior high. It is really fun to sing too and has very different musical styles. And lastly bohemian rhapsodie. I remember the first time hearing that song on the radio. Late at night with Laura in our trundle beds. And the trending debate about how long the song was over 6min.
