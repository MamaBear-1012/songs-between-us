# A Black Mile To The Surface — Manchester Orchestra

*(Week 2 – picked by Kayla)*

This is my pick for you this week. This album came out the summer after Chloe died so I always feel think of her when I listen to it. I listened to it over and over on my two hour drive to UConn Waterbury for my Spanish summer class and I would take route 8 through all these gorgeous valleys in CT. I love so much about this album. My favorite thing is every song leads to the next one. I get tears in my eyes at the first song. The Alien makes me think of Chloe the most. And there’s a line he sings the whole time that repeats it something like “didn’t mean to” and I always think it was her message to me like she really didn’t mean to die. And that song the alien goes right into the sunshine which is his song to his daughter and i love that song so much too. The final song the silence is my favorite, the last verse is to his daughter and it just gets me every time. Lead singer is Andy hull and his dad  was a pastor so there’s a lot of struggle with god and trying to find yourself which I love and he’s got very hymn like vibe it’s hard to put in words.
