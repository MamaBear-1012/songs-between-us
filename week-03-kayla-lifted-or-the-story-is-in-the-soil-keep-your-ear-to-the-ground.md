# LIFTED or the Story is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground — Bright Eyes

*(Week 3 – picked by Kayla)*

Here’s my album for this week. Lifted or the story is in the soil keep your ear to the ground by Bright Eyes. Conor Oberst is my favorite songwriter. This album has some of my absolute favorites of his songwriting. There are several songs on here that I would say are in my top 10. Idk why but his voice reminds of Robert smith sometimes. And i believe he was heavily influenced by the cure so I’ve always thought of you when I listen to him and think like how cool her band made my favorite songwriter. I’ve been listening to this album since I was 21 so it’s been through everything with me. The song you will. You? Will. You? Will. Me and Tamar always used to do a funny bit where we would go you will? Will you? You will? So I always laugh to myself when i see this song come on. Make War i listened to when I was taking a shuttle back from kayla Wray’s to airport after we broke up and it was like 6 am and the sun was coming up over the desert. A day is gonna come, waste of paint and let’s not shit ourselves are some of my favorite songs ever in the entire world. Bowls of oranges is a such a great song too. I think he has a very beautiful view on life and being a human between all the sadness.
