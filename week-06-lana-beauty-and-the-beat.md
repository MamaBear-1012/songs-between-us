# Beauty and the Beat — The Go-Go's

*(Week 6 – picked by Lana)*

This came out when I was a sophmore in high school. I loved them and I loved this record. I still know all the songs. It is #400 on top 500. The first single our lips are sealed was so good. There were no real girl bands at the time so this was really unheard of - well in my world at the time. They didn’t look hardened and mean like a lot of women in rock. It is just fun to listen to it would be hard to pick a favorite more like less favorites (we got the beat, can’t stop the world, skidmarks on my heart, you can’t walk in your sleep) the rest are so good I couldn’t even rank them. This was my first concert. They opened for the Police (never been a fan of them).  I think they lip synched but it was a fun concert. I hope you dance around to this one. 👯‍♀️
