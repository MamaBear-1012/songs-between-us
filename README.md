A weekly album letter exchange by Lana & Kayla

<img src="IMG_3133.jpg" alt="Kayla & Lana" width="260" align="right" />

A mother–daughter project told through music — one album at a time.

Each week, we pick an album for the other to listen to.
Then we write a letter about why it matters, what it reminds us of, or what we hope the other person hears in it.

This repository is our shared archive — a little musical time capsule we’re building together.

## 💬 **Why We're Doing This**
Music has always been part of our story — long drives, kitchen dancing, concerts, and quiet moments.  
This project gives us a way to keep sharing, even across distance and busy lives.

It’s a ritual, a conversation, and a little gift we give each other every week.
