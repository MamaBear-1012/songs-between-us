# Van Halen — Van Halen

*(Week 4 – picked by Lana)*

Are you ready for Week 4? I almost forgot about this one. I didn’t own it, Laura did. And I would secretly borrow and listen to this album. It was a game changer in hard rock it came out when I was 12 in Junior High. This is when I was really heavy into gymnastics and when Laura started partying really hard. This is VanHalen’s 1st album and was remarkable at the time because David Lee Roth the lead singer had an interesting voice, with cool screams, he was drop dead gorgeous, had the most beautiful smile, was an incredible showman. Then Eddie VanHalen the lead guitarist played like no one else on the planet. I am sure he is still known as one of the greatest guitar players of all time.  And Michael Anthony he is what gives VanHalen the harmony. I would have probably liked them much more later on but when they fired David Lee Roth it made me mad. All the songs on this album are great. But the standouts: Running with the Devil, Eruption (mind blowing), You Really Got Me, Jamie’s Cryin’, Feel Your Lovin Tonight, Ice Cream Man - didn’t realize until now that the sexual overtones in that one - oh oh. Anyways it is a lot of fun and play it loud! I hope you like it.
