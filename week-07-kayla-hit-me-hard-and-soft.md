# Hit Me Hard and Soft — Billie Eilish

*(Week 7 – picked by Kayla)*

My pick for you this week is Billie! This album came out two summers ago and I still listen to it all the time. In fact, Spotify sends you your listening statistics for the year and in 2023, I was in top .5% of listeners for this album 🤣 It’s a great album to run too. When I first listened to this, I was not a Billie fan. I liked a few of her songs but that was it. And the first two times I listened through this album I was like well that was pretty mediocre and basic but somewhere between 3rd and 4th listen, the album transformed into one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard. Billie has something called synesthesia which means she sees color when she hears music. What colors does this album make you think of? Idk how much you know about Billie. But her brother and her write and record all the music together. And they have pioneered a new way of edit and layering vocal tracks. Sometimes they’ll have 50 different vocal tracks of her in one song. It’s actually pretty incredible and I say this as someone who was little snobby about pop music before I love every song on this album except lunch which is the single. I wish they would take the last 3 songs and make a long music video to it. Chihiro is probably my favorite song of the album I could listen to it on a loop. Blue is not far behind. I wonder what you will think 🤔
