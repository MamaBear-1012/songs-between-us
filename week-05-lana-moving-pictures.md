# Moving Pictures — Rush

*(Week 5 – picked by Lana)*

My 1st high school boyfriend Jason Monkelien introduced me to this album. I remember hearing the song Red Barchetta and just feeling that it was a musical story that i could actually visualize. It was like reading a book where I envisioned the scenery, characters and the story in my mind.  The most popular songs: Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Vital Signs, are great - but Red Barchetta is on my list of my favorite songs There are just three members in the band and the music that these three people can make is just ridiculously brilliant. When they were accepted into the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame - Alex Lifeson’s Blah Blah speech remains as the best speech I have ever seen by anyone. I hope you love this one. 🥰
